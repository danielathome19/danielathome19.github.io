    <h3>Original Survey Post:</h3>
    <p>This survey will present a musical Turing test for a new (W.I.P.) generative AI model for 4-part (SATB) choral music as part of a Ph.D. dissertation evaluation. You will be presented with 5 audio samples rendered from MIDI using a choir soundfont; some of them will be AI-generated, the others will be human-composed (i.e., compositions from real composers), and you simply need to respond with which one you believe the piece was composed by. The samples will be ~30-60 seconds long and may be from any part of the original MIDI, not necessarily the beginning.
       To prevent potential bias, please listen to this brief audio sample (of a real piece of choral music) rendered with the soundfont so you know what to expect all 5 samples to sound like. Then, choose "Yes" to proceed if you have read and understand these terms.

    <p>All samples were judged using a 6-point Likert scale:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>AI - Strongly believe</li>
      <li>AI - Mostly believe</li>
      <li>AI - Somewhat believe</li>
      <li>Human - Somewhat believe</li>
      <li>Human - Mostly believe</li>
      <li>Human - Strongly believe</li>
